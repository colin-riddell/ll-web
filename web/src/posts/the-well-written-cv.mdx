The role of the CV or resume is simple. It’s a way of communicating your skills and experience such that a reader quickly can determine if they wish to consider you for a position within their company and for the role that’s advertised. It’s not a document that should try to convince someone to hire you. It’s not a formal record of every project you’ve worked on, every product you’ve helped build and every job you’ve had. 
The concept of a CV is simple, yet despite that it’s one of the hardest things to put together. 

The perfect CV has the following traits - we’ll discuss each trait in a series of blog posts

* **Part 1 (this post)** - **The well written CV**. With simple and very honest language that doesn’t waste the readers time with cliched and obvious statements. The contents aim to present an overview of you and your abilities. Rather than overwhelm the reader with an account of everything about you.
* **Part 2** - *coming soon* - **The Well formatted CV** The formatting and presentation is easy on the eye with a familiar font and colour scheme and a layout that doesn’t confuse the reader. The reader isn’t bamboozled with a wacky design (unless you’re applying for a designer job?)
* **Part 3** - *coming soon* - **The accessible CV** It’s available in any format required such as PDF, Web, Markdown and paper. Never .doc! It’s conveniently editable and updateable by the author but at the same time drafts of the document should be easy to share with mentors and advisers when seeking assistance.



Going through these three traits mentioned above one-by-one I’ll explain each in detail and provide examples of **Do's** and **Don'ts** of how to write the perfect Software Engineering CV.

 In this first post I’ll discuss what makes a “well written” CV. **I’ll take a junior - mid engineer slant on it**, but this advice of course applies to anyone.

Keep an eye out for Part 2 - The Well formatted CV coming soon.

# Part 1: The well written CV

## Fancy language

It’s all too tempting when writing your CV to use language that makes you sound intelligent or allows you to show off your amazing grasp of the English language. You may well have an amazing grasp on the English language - and if you have that’s great. When writing your CV, showing off how fancy you can get with words is not a great idea. Why:
There is a chance that you mess up and use a phrase or word incorrectly. It could be something you’ve never typed in your life so why start using it now in your CV.
It adds too many words. We’ll come to this in a bit, but trying to sound fancy just adds lots of words that you don’t need.

**Don’t** ❌:
---
> *My ability to demonstrate a keen and precise understanding of the intricacies of the aforementioned technology is evident not only due to continued commitment to acquiring new experiences with it.*
---

**Do** ✅:
---
> *I had to become familiar with this technology very quickly.*
---

## Too many words

**Use fewer words**. Imagine that someone’s charging you money for each word you write. Not only will you end up with a more concise document, but it will also force you to be more critical about the content.  If you find yourself trying to get across as many points as possible, like in the example below.. Try reading it back to yourself and then try to summarise it in one or maybe two sentences. 
Also, try and use context to imply what you want the reader to assume. And remember to tie it back to technology.

**Don’t** ❌:
---
> I am a proactive person who brings out the best in others, who brings a team together and pursues solutions through collaborative working, as well as individually. I have a  background in various types of retail, as well as working in hospitality and managing restaurants as well as working for a major office supplies company doing sales. I wanted to do something different and push my career so I took to my passion from childhood, working with computers. So I applied to a  software development bootcamp. Thus, I have developed strong communication skills, engaging different stakeholders such as clients,  managers, and coworkers. While working on high workloads and in a fast-paced environment, I have also  mastered my organisation and prioritisation abilities. I am a reliable person who is punctual and polite and hard working.
---

**Do** ✅:
---
> I have experience across retail, hospitality and sales. These vital human and communication skills have helped me adapt when becoming a Software Engineer as part of an intense career changing course.
---

It’s easy to trick ourselves into thinking that everyone hangs on every word we write. Sadly, it’s not the case. Stop throwing words into these parts of your CV for the sake of it.

Less is more.

## The Cliches

There are many things people put on their CV’s that deliver absolutely no relevant value at all. These are often traits that we believe the interviewer or the person reading the document wants to read. These are things like “hard worker”, “punctual”, “responsible”, “strong communication” etc.

The problem with these statements is that as a professional technologist, these things are taken as a given. It can be assumed, within reason, that if you’re applying for a technical position like Software Engineer/Analyst, that you’ve already got these completely nailed down and are doing them day-in-day-out. Try to think of these as prerequisites to being the well-functioning human that underpins the professional you. Does that mean they shouldn’t be stated? Maybe not, but I wouldn’t state them as obviously.

 Instead, when describing your qualities make sure they’re obviously implied by your abilities/achievements.


**Don’t** ❌
---
> I am a reliable, punctual and hard working team player who can deliver results on time. I take my work seriously and can communicate well. I can engage with different stakeholders such as clients,  managers, and coworkers. I can work in a fast paced environment and learn on the job.
---

**Do** ✅:
---
> From working in an agile scrum team I’ve learned how the agile mindset can help a self-organising team. I thrive in agile teams that have a cross-functional mix of disciplines.
---

Here, mentioning Scrum, speaks volumes more than mentioning each quality that being a functioning member of a scrum team needs. Many basic qualities like good communication, team work etc are prerequisites of being able to appreciate the value of a team-based discipline like Scrum.
> I thrive in a cross functional mix of disciplines

This is an introspective sentence. It tells the reader that you’ve thought about where you perform best. At the same time it shows that you value that experience.

## The life story

Many of us have diverse work backgrounds with many different and interesting jobs. 

If these jobs all took place before the start of our professional career in technology, then the brutal truth is that their importance is far less significant than you think. If you’re not a career changer, and you’ve spent the last 15 years in tech, then similar advice applies, to some extent and that is: keep your experience record brief and relevant.

### Keep role history relevant

The most important point here is the relevant part. For example, In this snippet, the candidate had dozens of jobs before commencing on their professional career in tech. In this case, as difficult as it may be, these roles are not relevant to your attitudes and abilities as a Software Engineer. This statement could be argued with, but in my experience, going into a lot of detail in non-related experiences doesn’t give any sense of even the potential of their abilities as an engineer, other than that they can actually work in a job.

**Don’t** ❌

**Do** ✅:
---
> **2000** -> **2015**
> 
> Various roles across hospitality, retail and business. Please ask if you would like an insight into these.
---

That’s probably an extreme case.. In a situation where there are one or two roles outside of your technical career, it’s good to list these, but important to keep them brief and focus on relevant points as much as possible. 

### Highlight technical related roles if you have them

It’s important to highlight relevant technical experience of any kind.. For example if you’ve worked in a semi-technical capacity in Customer Support..


**Do** ✅:
---
> **2020 - 2021 - John Lewis Customer Services**
> * Customer support over the phone dealing with the CRM system, people with payments and interacting with the web development team
> 
> **2018 - 2020 - John Lewis Retail**
> * Working in store retail
---

If you’ve a long professional career in tech, then please try to apply a similar mindset. But in this case it’s good to mention the roles you’ve had but keep them brief and becoming more brief as you go further back in time For example:

**Do** ✅:
---
> **2020 - 2022 - Development Lead : Acme Ltd**
> * Architecting main product, mentoring junior engineers. Responsible for technology choices for large migration projects. 
> * Key role in designing and implementing move to a CDN with CloudFront. Built caching layer which improved performance of services by 50% 
> * Tech used: Terraform, TS, JS, Node, React, Java, GO, k8s,
> 
> **2018 - 2020 - Software Engineer : YDesign**
> * Backend and infrastructure focus on scoring centralisation project for gaming company.
> * Tech Used: Java, Node, k8s, Apache Spark, MongoDB
>
> **2012 - 2018 - Software Engineer : Code Quality Ltd**
> * Played a keyKey role in a large project delivering VOIP system to clients. 
> * Tech used: C++, Java, Erlang
> 
> **2009 - 2018 - Software Engineer : My First Job ltd**
> * Building widgets
> * Tech used: Java, JavaScript, C++, HTML
---

If you’ve even more roles stretching further back consider summarising them with:

---
> **2002 - 2009 - Various Software related roles**
---

## STAR or -T-R if you can

**STAR**  stands for **Situation**, **Task**, **Action**,  **Reward**.

It’s a way of describing your achievements in a way that shows you’re able to articulate and understand the value of your achievements.
With STAR, you’re supposed to explain the situation, elaborate on the task you identified, describe what action you took and then go into detail on the benefit that had - the reward.

I personally think that applying STAR to each and every achievement can get very dull, very quickly. It’s a little over the top, for most situations.
However it’s important to keep the essence of what STAR is saying in mind. That’s simply to try as much as possible to explain what value your achievement delivered.

A very simple example:

**Don’t** ❌:
---
> *Responsible for building caching middleware using Redis + Java*
---

**Do** ✅:
---
> *Built caching middleware using Redis + Java. This delivered a 50% reduction in hits on underlying services and improved application performance.*
---


## What makes you tick?

We see this all the time.. A CV introduction that has zero personality and doesn’t tell the reader anything about what that individual loves or loathes.
In a professional technology setting you’re being hired for your opinions and as professionals we should learn to wield them correctly so please try and ooze love for what you want to do. 

You don’t need to be passionate about technologies that relate to your work, but honestly, it helps. 
It might not be tech that you’re passionate about.. It could be supporting or mentoring others or championing including and speaking up for real diversity in your workplace. Don’t hide behind what you really think and really feel. Keep in mind that you’re looking for a workplace that shares the same values as you.

**Don’t** ❌:
---
> *I have 1 years experience as a Junior Software engineer. I really like it. I like working on projects that go to production and helping my team achieve their sprint goals. I’ve used next.js in my projects. I can engage with different stakeholders such as clients,  managers, and coworkers. I can work in a fast paced environment and learn on the job.*
---

SNORE! ☝️  😴🥱

**Do** ✅:
---
> *In my year of working professionally as an engineer I’ve realised that I absolutely love working with Next.js. This technology has me really excited for the future of the web. I’m so passionate about  helping introduce technologies like next.js into the teams I work with. The feeling of collaborative success when something goes to production keeps me engaged as a software engineer.*
---


**Or maybe this** ✅:
---
> *In the first couple of years of my career I’ve unlocked my passion for helping and mentoring others in my team. I hate to see someone struggle so I dedicate some time each week to helping less experienced people in the team get to grips with the codebase. This unlocked a passion for mentoring I didn't realise I had.*
---

It’s important to tap into what you like or don’t like. The document gives so much more insight into the human when you do. Keep in mind another human is reading it. Imagine that they’re asking you the question “What do you *really* love about your work”.


## The takeaways 🥡

Let's quickly recap the big points:

* **Fight the urge to use fancy words and complicated language**. Simpler is best. You **won't** sound stupid for keeping things simple - if anything the opposite.
* Distil your experiences down and **try to use fewer words in general**.
* **Avoid the obvious cliches** like "hard-working" and "team player". Use your experience to prove you have these prerequisite traits.
* **Avoid telling your life story** and keep your experience list relevant.
* **Backup your achievements with evidence**, where possible, on how your actions helped. Remember STAR! Use it wisely.
* **Communicate your opinion but wield it sensibly**. Tell us what you love. Too much opinion makes you sound like a crack-pot. No opinion makes it harder to read into the character of you. I often tell people to "bleed a little bit" on their CV. I hope nobody's ever taken that literally :P

That’s it for **Part 1** - **The well written CV**
